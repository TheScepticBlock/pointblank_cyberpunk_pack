# Cyberpunk 2077 Guns for Vic's Point Blank
This is a content pack for the Vic's Point Blank mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 and 1.21.1 that aims to recreate Cyberpunk 2077's weaponry and put them into Minecraft.

This repository will contain every model I have created so far for the pack along with everything I will (eventually) add for Pointblank: Jelly, a fork of Vic's Point Blank.

The current goals are:
- To add every gun (and potentially melee) featured in Cyberpunk 2077 into Minecraft with a simple geometry style with good quality animations
- Faithfully recreate the feel of each weapon and give them unique characteristics to help them stand out from one another
- Have each weapon balanced around mid-late game with modded entities
